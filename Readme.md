[ 18, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
```

`PROPERTIES:` Means The Properties Of Tank If You Didn't add Properties It Will Not Shoot So `PROPERTIES: {`

`SHOOT_SETTINGS: combineStats([g.?]),` Means The Shoot Settings of the tank if you put many the shoot bullet will strong or weak.
(If you Want Own Go To The Top And Find **const g =**
 So `SHOOT_SETTINGS: combineStats([g.basic]),`
 
`TYPE:` Means What Type Of Bullet It Shoot
`TYPE: exports.bullet` Or `TYPE: exports.drone` Or `TYPE: exports.trap` So I'll Pick `TYPE: exports.bullet`

If Its Done Type/Copy This:

};
```
If You Want Another Barrel Type/Copy This:
```
}, }, {//. L. W. A. X. Y. a. D
POSITION: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
